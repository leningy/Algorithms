# Algorithms and Laws 
- De Morgans Laws: 1. the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations
                   2. the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations
                   
- Gradient descent： a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function
- KL Divergence: measure of how one probability distribution is different from a second, reference probability distribution
- Activation function (激活函数): In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs
